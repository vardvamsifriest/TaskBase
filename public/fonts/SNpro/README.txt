SN Pro Variable Font
====================

This download contains SN Pro as both variable fonts and static fonts.

SN Pro is a variable font with this axis:
  wght

This means all the styles are contained in these files:
  SN_Pro/SNPro-VariableFont_wght.ttf
  SN_Pro/SNPro-Italic-VariableFont_wght.ttf

If your app fully supports variable fonts, you can now pick intermediate styles
that aren’t available as static fonts. Not all apps support variable fonts, and
in those cases you can use the static font files for SN Pro:
  SN_Pro/static/SNPro-ExtraLight.ttf
  SN_Pro/static/SNPro-Light.ttf
  SN_Pro/static/SNPro-Regular.ttf
  SN_Pro/static/SNPro-Medium.ttf
  SN_Pro/static/SNPro-SemiBold.ttf
  SN_Pro/static/SNPro-Bold.ttf
  SN_Pro/static/SNPro-ExtraBold.ttf
  SN_Pro/static/SNPro-Black.ttf
